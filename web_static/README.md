**It is time to talk about HTML, the language used to create web pages.

HTML is the language used to define the content of web pages. Basically it is a set of tags used to define the text and other elements that make up a web page, such as images, lists, videos, etc..

HTML was originally created for the purpose of disseminating information with text and some images. It was not intended to be used to create a multimedia leisure and consultation area (what the web is today), so HTML was created without responding to all the possible uses that would be given to it and to all the groups of people who would use it in the future. However, despite this poor planning, modifications have been incorporated over time, these are the HTML standards. Numerous standards have already been introduced. HTML 4.01 is the latest standard as of February 2001. Updated in May 2005, version 5 of HTML is about to be presented, of which an almost definitive draft is already available.

HTML is a markup language for the creation of hypertext documents, very easy to learn, which allows anyone, even if they have never programmed in life, can face the task of creating a web. HTML is easy and soon we will be able to master the language. Later we will achieve professional results thanks to our design skills and our artistic vein, as well as the incorporation of other languages to define the format with which the webs have to be presented, such as [CSS](http://www.desarrolloweb.com/articulos/26.php).

Now that we know the concept of HTML, we are going to tell you a few more things. This language is written in a text document, so we need a text editor to write a web page. So, the file where the HTML code is contained is a text file, with a peculiarity, that has extension .html or .htm (it does not matter which one to use). So when we program in HTML we will do it with a text editor, as simple as possible and we will save our work with extension .html, for example mipagina.html.

To advance a little how HTML is used, we will tell you that the language consists of tags that have this form `<B>` or `<P>`. Each tag means one thing, for example `<B>` means bold, or `<P>` means a paragraph, `<A>` is a link, etc. Almost all tags have a corresponding closing tag, which indicates that after that point the tag should not be affected. For example `</B>` is used to indicate to stop writing in bold. So HTML is nothing more than a series of tags that are used to define the content of the document and some basic styling. `<B>This is bold</B>`.

**Note:** HTML is not case sensitive, so `<B>` would be equivalent to `<b>`. It is common for developers to write tags in lowercase.
